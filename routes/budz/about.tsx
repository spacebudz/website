                SpaceBudz, founded by Zieg and Alessandro, was launched in March
                2021 on the Cardano blockchain. It quickly became a beloved
                project in the Cardano community, renowned for its
                groundbreaking work in NFTs. SpaceBudz was the first to mint an
                NFT collection, establish an NFT metadata standard, and launch a
                fully smart contract-based marketplace. The founders created
                SpaceBudz out of their curiosity and passion for Cardano and
                blockchain technology. They are dedicated to open-source
                principles and believe in the power of decentralization. They
                aim to keep these values at the heart of the SpaceBudz project,
                ensuring that it remains true to its roots.
