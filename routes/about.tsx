        SpaceBudz, launched in March 2021 on the Cardano blockchain by Zieg and
        Alessandro, is an early NFT project on Cardano known for its
        contributions to the ecosystem. It was among the first to introduce key
        advancements such as an NFT metadata standard and a fully smart
        contract-based marketplace. Born from a passion for Cardano and
        blockchain technology, the project reflects a commitment to open-source
        principles and decentralization. These core values remain at the heart
        of the SpaceBudz project, guiding it to stay true to its origins.
